First NLP Project to test spacy Library


Completed this project when I first started my journey with Artificial Intelligence, later used this as a demo in my python class.

A solid project to help introdue beginners to nlp, good way to help beginners understand tokenization

Function:

Display tokenized parts of speech of any given input
